          <h1>Encryption</h1>
          <p>[OWASP: Guide to Cryptography](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Guide_to_Cryptography)</p>
          <p>This week will we look into encryption. Any time you are storing sensitive data that your clients wouldn't want
            make public, it is important to encrypt that data to protect it from leaks or hacks. We will start by learning
            about the most common encryption methods in use today, then we will work on using encryption to secure our user's
            information in the blogging app.
          </p>

          <h2>Types of Encryption</h2>
          <p>**Symmetric Cryptography**</p>
          <p>With Symmetric Cryptography, data is encrypted and decrypted with the same key. Some examples of symmetric algorithms:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>DES (weak)</li>
              <li>3DES</li>
              <li>AES</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>**Asymmetric Cryptography**</p>
          <p>Also called Public/Private Key Cryptography, asymmetric algorithms always have two keys, one to encrypt the data
            and another to decrypt the data. One key is generally labeled the Public key and can be distributed. The other
            key is the Private key and must be kept hidden.
          </p>
          <p>Examples:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>PGP</li>
            <li>SSL</li>
          </ul>

          <p>**Hashes**</p>
          <p>Hash functions take some data of an arbitrary length (and possibly a key or password) and generate a fixed-length
            hash based on this input. Hash functions used in cryptography have the property that it is easy to calculate
            the hash, but difficult or impossible to re-generate the original input if only the hash value is known. In addition,
            hash functions useful for cryptography have the property that it is difficult to craft an initial input such
            that the hash will match a specific desired value.</p>
          <p>Examples:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>MD5 (weak)</li>
            <li>SHA-1 (weak)</li>
            <li>SHA-256</li>
          </ul>

          <p>**Key Exchange Algorithms**</p>
          <p>Key exchange algorithms allow us to safely exchange encryption keys with unknown parties. Diffie-Hellman, used
            in SSL certs, is an example.</p>


          <h2>NodeJS Crypto</h2>
          <p>NodeJS has a built-in cryptography library which we should rely on anytime we need encryption or true random numbers.
            We can find the documentation here:</p>
          <p>[NodeJS: Crypto](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html)</p>
          <p>Here is a good starter article on implementing encryption in NodeJS:</p>
          <p>[Encrypt and decrypt content with Nodejs](http://lollyrock.com/articles/nodejs-encryption/)</p>

          <h2>Key Management</h2>
          <p>[Wiki: Key Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_management)</p>
          <p>It is important for us to protect the data of our customers in the case of a server breach. We also need to assume
            that the hacker will have lots of time to try and crack encrypted data if they manage to steal our database,
            so we must use strong encryption with good practices. A big no-no is storing the secret keys in the same place
            as the data. If we do this, then it is trivial for the hacker to decrypt the data. Instead, we must make it difficult
            for anyone to get access to the secret keys, while still allowing our application to use the key.
          </p>

          <h2>Encrypting Database Fields</h2>
          <p>[AWS: Field-Level Encryption](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-enhance-the-security-of-sensitive-customer-data-by-using-amazon-cloudfront-field-level-encryption/)</p>

          <h1>SSL/TLS Certificates</h1>
          <p>SSL Certificates use public key cryptography to encrypt web traffic between a server and a web browser. Public
            key cryptography is a type of asymmetric cryptography, meaning there is a private and a public key. The web server
            uses the private key and your web browser uses the public key. </p>

          <p>SSL Certificates must be signed by a Root Certificate, which is a globally trusted certificate managed by a Certificate
            Authority. A Certificate Authority is a company like GlobalSign or DigiCert who is trusted by browser and operating
            system vendors to sign and issue certificates. Our computers and mobile devices maintain a list of the trusted
            CA Root Certificates. This allows them to verify the legitimacy of an SSL Certificate. That is how Chrome knows
            it can trust a website when it shows the green lock next to the URL.</p>

          <h2>Creating Self-Signed Certificates using OpenSSL</h2>
          <p>The easiest certificate to generate is a self-signed certificate. These types of certificates will show an error
            in web browsers because they are not signed by a Root Authority. However, they will still work, and are useful
            for testing.
          </p>
          <p>We will use a command line tool called [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) to generate our self-signed certificate.</p>
          <p>This command will let us create a certificate. OpenSSL will prompt us for additional information required by the
            certificate.
          </p>
          <script type='template/code' class='cs'>
            openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
          </script>
          <p>It is also possible to generate a certificate fully automatically, with no prompts from OpenSSL</p>
          <script type='template/code'>
            openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -subj "/C=US/ST=Oregon/L=Portland/O=Company Name/OU=Org/CN=www.example.com"
          </script>
          <p>It is possible to do this process within a Dockerfile to create an SSL cert when a container is built.</p>
          <script type='template/code' class='cs'>
            CMD /usr/bin/openssl genrsa -out /certs/${KEY_NAME}.key 1024 && \
            /usr/bin/openssl req  -new -newkey rsa:4096 -days 365 -nodes -subj "/C=/ST=/L=/O=/CN=${COMMON_NAME}" -keyout /certs/${KEY_NAME}.key -out /certs/${KEY_NAME}.csr  && \
            /usr/bin/openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in /certs/${KEY_NAME}.csr -signkey /certs/${KEY_NAME}.key -out /certs/${KEY_NAME}.crt
          </script>

          <div class='outline'>
            <h3>In-Class: Create a Certificate</h3>
            <p>Let's SSH into our application 03-HttpsExpressBasic and generate an SSL certificate. Use the following command
              to SSH into the container.</p>
            <script type='template/code'>
              docker exec -it 03httpsexpressbasic_webapp_1 /bin/bash
            </script>
            <p>Put your certificate in the `/cert` folder and update the `PASSPHRASE` env variable.</p>
          </div>

          <h2>Using Wireshark to Verify our Certificate</h2>
          <p>[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) is a tool that will allow us to sniff the packets traveling in our network.</p>
          <p>Start up Wireshark and listen on the `loopback` device. Now try visiting our app using the unencrypted port `8080`
            and the secure port `4443`.</p>
          <p>Filter the Wireshark results to see the unencrypted traffic by using this filter: `tcp.port == 8080`.</p>
          <p>Do the same with the encrypted traffic: `tcp.port == 4443`. Notice the difference between the two types of traffic?</p>

          <h2>Docker Certificate Using Docker Secret</h2>
          <p>[Dockerflow: Certs](https://proxy.dockerflow.com/certs/)</p>

          <h2>Getting Certificates</h2>
          <p>The traditional option for getting a certificate for your site has always been to purchase one from a Certificate
            Authority, such as DigiCert. Let's take a look at their site: </p>
          <p>[DigiCert](https://www.digicert.com/)</p>
          <p>Today, there is a much cheapter (read: free) option. [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) allows us to generate
            certificates for free, and we can even automate their creation and renewal.</p>

          <h2>Automating Certificate Renewal</h2>
          <p>Let's Encrypt offers an API for generating and renewing certificates. Let's take a look at some NPM modules that
            will let us automate our certificates.</p>
          <p>[greenlock-express](https://github.com/Daplie/greenlock-express)</p>

          <h2>Using Let's Encrypt with a Web Host</h2>
          <p>I will demonstrate (or at least attempt) to user Let's Encrypt to add a certificate to my website hosted on Arvixe,
            which uses Cpanel.</p>
