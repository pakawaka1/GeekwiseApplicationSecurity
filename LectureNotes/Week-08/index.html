          <h1>MongoDB Vulnerabilities</h1>
          <p>NoSQL databases are a type of storage structure that use a mechanism other than the tabular relations used in relational
            databases. As a result, these types of databases usually are not vulnerable to SQL injection. However that doesn't
            mean they are inherently more secure. Instead they have their own vulnerabilities to contend with.
          </p>
          <p>MongoDB is one of the more popular NoSQL databases, and is a primary component of MEAN stack. As a result, we will
            focus on MongoDB for our examples.</p>
          <p>To start us off, here is the list of known vulnerabilities in MongoDB:</p>
          <p>[MongoDB Vulnerability List](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-12752/product_id-25450/Mongodb-Mongodb.html)</p>

          <p>Throughout this lecture, we will be using code and notes created by David Bohannon on the Synopsys.com blog.</p>
          <p>[Bohannon: Preventing Common Vulnerabilties: Part 1](https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/preventing-common-mean-stack-vulnerabilities/)</p>
          <p>[Bohannon: Source Code](https://github.com/dbohannon/MEANBug)</p>

          <h2>Insecure Configuration</h2>
          <p>Between Christmas 2016 and mid-January 2017, 28,000 public MongoDB installations were hacked due to insecure default
            settings. MongoDB versions before 2.6.0 would, by default, be open to remote connections without requiring authentication.
          </p>
          <p>[The MongoDB Hack](https://snyk.io/blog/mongodb-hack-and-secure-defaults/)</p>

          <h2>Query Selector Injection</h2>
          <p>While MongoDB is not susceptible to SQL injection, it is vulnerable to a similar attack called Query Selector Injection.
            MongoDB's query language uses special keywords such as `$where` and `$ne`. In a vulnerable implementation, it
            is possible for an attacker to pass these parameters into API fields and manipulate the result, or worse.
          </p>
          <p>[OWASP: Testing for NoSQL Injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_NoSQL_injection)</p>

          <h2>Security Checklist</h2>
          <p>MongoDB supplies a security checklist which includes the following topics:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Enable access control and enforce authentication</li>
              <li>Configure role-based access control</li>
              <li>Encrypt communication</li>
              <li>Limit network expose</li>
              <li>Audit system activity</li>
              <li>Run MongoDB with a dedicated user</li>
              <li>Request a Security Technical Implemeation Guide (where applicable)</li>
              <li>Consider Security Standards Compliance</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>[Security Checklist](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/security-checklist/)</p>


          <h2>Mass Assignment</h2>
          <p>[Mass Assignment Cheatsheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Mass_Assignment_Cheat_Sheet)</p>
          <p>Software frameworks sometime allow developers to automatically bind HTTP request parameters into program code variables
            or objects to make using that framework easier on developers. This can sometimes cause harm. Attackers can sometimes
            use this methodology to create new parameters that the developer never intended which in turn creates or overwrites
            new variable or objects in program code that was not intended. This is called a mass assignment vulnerability.</p>
          <p>Alternate names:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>**Mass Assignment**: Ruby on Rails, NodeJS</li>
              <li>**Autobinding**: Spring MVC, ASP.NET MVC</li>
              <li>**Object injection**: PHP</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>To defend against this, we should use whitelisting, blacklisting, or a combinantion of the two to make sure sensitive
            or unintended fields are not editable by external forces.</p>
          <p>For MongoDB, we can use a Schema to define the expected structure of our objects. More on that can be found here:</p>
          <p>[Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html)</p>

          <h1>Common Vulnerabilities in ExpressJS</h1>
          <p>[Bohannon: Preventing Common Vulnerabilties: Part 2](https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/preventing-common-expressjs-mean-stack-vulnerabilities/)</p>
          <h2>ExpressJS: Stack Precendence</h2>
          <p>The order of app middlewares in your Express applications is critical. In our MEANBug app, the `/secure/removeInvoice`
            endpoint is implemented before the authentication check, therefore an unathenticated user can delete invoices.
          </p>
          <h2>ExpressJS: Case-insensitive routing</h2>
          <p>When creating access rules based on routes, it is critical that your code is not case-sensitive. In MEANBug, all
            routes beginning with `/secure` require the user to be logged in. However if I connecte with `/SECURE`, the authentication
            middleware doesn't match the route, even though the endpoint handling code does!
          </p>
          <p>[Bohannon: Preventing Common Vulnerabilties: Part 3](https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/preventing-common-expressjs-mean-stack-vulnerabilities-part2/)</p>
          <h2>Client-Side Session Storage</h2>
          <p>It is common in MEAN applications to store the session state client-side. This makes the application simpler and
            more scalable, but makes it so that we can't invalidate the user's session easily or consistently. This can lead
            to session replay or hijacking attacks. One way to mitigate this is to also do server-side session invalidation.
            Look at last week's lecture for ideas on how we can use a security stamp to do this.
          </p>
          <h2>CSRF Protection</h2>
          <p>We discussed CSRF protection in Week 05. We can use the `Csurf` module to protect our application. By default,
            the module will not protect `GET`, `HEAD`, or `OPTION` methods. As we have discussed before, we should not put
            state-modifying actions on `GET` methods. In this case, they would not be protected from CSRF. In MEANBug, the
            `secure/removeInvoice` endpoint uses a `GET` method, which is insecure. We should consider switching it to use
            `POST` for more security.
          </p>

          <h1>Common Vulnerabilities in Angular</h1>
          <h2>AngularJS</h2>
          <p>[Bohannon: Preventing Common Vulnerabilties: Part 4](https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/preventing-common-angularjs-vulnerabilities/)</p>
          <h3>XSS Protection</h3>
          <p>By default, the SCE service strips malicious HTML tags, attributes, and URI protocols from data rended as HTML
            with the `ng-bind-html` directive. If this is disabled using `$sceProvider.enabled(false)` it can leave our application
            susceptible to script injections. It is important to leave the SCE service enabled. We should also use the `ng-bind`
            directive when rendering data, as this will perform HTML encdoing on all malicious characters.
          </p>
          <h3>AngularJS Expression Injection</h3>
          <p>Angular templates use the double curly braces to denote expressions that are evaluated by the Angular rendering
            engine. We should make sure that users are not able to inject curly braces into a template. This can be used
            to circumvent HTML sanitization. For example, on the MEANBug login screen, this url would not allow a script
            to run:
          </p>
          <script type='template/code'>
            http://localhost:9000/login?user=<script>alert(‘XSS_SUCCESS!’)</ script>
          </script>
          <p>However, by adding curly braces, we can get our XSS injection to work:</p>
          <script type='template/code' class='xml'>
            http://localhost:9000/login?user={{constructor.constructor(‘alert(“XSS_SUCCESS!”)’)()}}
          </script>

          <h2>Angular 2+</h2>
          <p>[Angular Security](https://angular.io/guide/security)</p>
          <p>For Angular 2+, let's take a look at Angular's own security guide page.</p>

          <h1>Common Vulnerabilities in NodeJS</h1>
          <p>[Bohannon: Preventing Common Vulnerabilties: Part 5](https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/nodejs-mean-stack-vulnerabilities/)</p>
          <h2>Development Mode</h2>
          <p>In development mode, NodeJS returns more rebose error messages which can leak information you don't want the public
            to have. Make sure to set `NODE_ENV=production` on live servers, and double-check the NodeJS mode after deploying
            a project. I like to have a page that shows project version and mode for this purpose.</p>

          <h2>NodeJS Privileges</h2>
          <p>On Unix systems, non-root users cannot bind to low-numbered ports. This means that NodeJS must be run as root to
            bind to port 80. However, if we sudo to root to start our web server then our application will be running with
            unnecessary privileges. To remedy this, invoke the process.setgid and process.setuid methods in the callback
            function after binding to port 80 as shown below.</p>
          <script type='template/code'>
            app.listen(80, function(){
              process.setgid('users');
              process.setuid('db');
            })
          </script>
          <p>[Special File Permissions](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19683-01/816-4883/secfile-69/index.html)</p>

          <h2>Node Security Platform</h2>
          <p>The Node Security Platform maintains a record of NodeJS plugins with known security issues. It can be installed
            and ran using the following lines:</p>
          <script type='template/code'>
            npm install -g nsp 
            nsp check
          </script>
